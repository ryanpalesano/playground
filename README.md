Level 2
When a user visits localhost:5000/play/(x), have it display the beautiful looking blue boxes x times. For example, localhost:5000/play/7 should display these blue boxes 7 times. Calling localhost:5000/play/35 would display these blue boxes 35 times. Please remember that x originally is a string, and if you want to use it as an integer, you must first convert it to integer using int(). For example int("7") returns 7.

Level 3
When a user visits localhost:5000/play/(x)/(color), have it display beautiful looking boxes x times, but this time where the boxes appear in (color). For example, localhost:5000/play/5/green would display 5 beautiful green boxes. Calling localhost:5000/play/35/red would display 35 beautiful red boxes.
